### Project 1: **[Virtual Network Penetration Testing Lab](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Virtual-Network-Penetration-Testing-Lab)**

**Objective:** Build a virtual lab environment for practicing penetration testing techniques

**Methodology:**
1. Set up a Virtual Network with pfSense Firewall
   - Installed and configured pfSense to act as a network gateway.
   - Created VLANs and segmented networks to simulate real-world environments.

2. Created and Configured Virtual Machines
   - Imported vulnerable machines from VulnHub for penetration testing.
   - Installed Kali Linux for ethical hacking and vulnerability assessments.
   - Built a simulated Active Directory environment using Windows Server 2019 as the domain controller and a Windows 10 client.

3. Simulated and Analyzed Attacks
   - Conducted penetration tests on vulnerable VMs and the Active Directory environment using tools from Kali Linux.
   - Used the pfSense firewall to monitor network traffic and control access between network segments.
   

**Achievements:**
  - Configured and secured virtual networks using VLANs and pfSense rules.
  - Identified vulnerabilities and exploited them using Kali Linux tools.
  - Tested potential attack vectors in a simulated AD environment and applied basic defenses.

**Learnings:**
  - Gained hands-on experience configuring subnets, VLANs, and firewalls using pfSense.
  - Practiced ethical hacking techniques using Kali Linux and exploited vulnerable systems from VulnHub.
  - Built and tested a small AD environment to explore attack surfaces and security controls.
  - Developed skills to analyze security issues and implement solutions.

### Project 2: **[Active Directory Security Lab](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Active-Directory-Security-Lab)**

**Objective:** Build a virtual lab environment for practicing Active Directory security and threat detection.

**Methodology:**
1. Set up a small Active Directory environment
    - Installed Windows Server and configured it as a domain controller.
    - Created user accounts, groups, and policies to replicate a real-world Active Directory structure.

2. Installed Splunk and Sysmon
   - Configured Splunk to ingest security logs from the domain environment.
   - Installed Sysmon to generate detailed event logs for improved visibility into system activities.
     
3. Generated attacks on the Active Directory domain
   - Used Kali Linux to simulate attacks like brute force, password spraying, and privilege escalation.
   - Caught and analyzed attack attempts in Splunk using real-time telemetry and alerts.

**Achievements:**
  - Successfully identified and logged various attacks (e.g., password spraying) with Sysmon logs ingested into Splunk.
  - Configured Splunk to generate automated alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized access attempts).
  - Demonstrated the ability to investigate and mitigate attack scenarios using Splunk dashboards and alerts.

**Learnings:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of domain environments and their role in managing user accounts and resources.
  - Learned how to configure and use Splunk to collect, analyze, and visualize security data.
  - Mastered the ingestion of Windows event logs and Sysmon data into Splunk for efficient threat analysis.
  - Developed skills in identifying common Active Directory threats and responding to them effectively.
  - Learned to simulate real-world attacks using Kali Linux and deploy mitigation strategies based on telemetry data.
  - Built confidence in investigating alerts, identifying attack vectors, and using SIEM data to mitigate risks in real-time.
