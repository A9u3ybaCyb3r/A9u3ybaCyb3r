  - Built and tested a small AD environment to explore attack surfaces and security controls.
  - Developed skills to analyze security issues and implement solutions.

### Project 2: **[Adaptive Threat Detection and Incident Response Lab](https://github.com/A9u3ybaCyb3r/Adaptive-Threat-Detection-and-Incident-Response-Lab)** 

**Objective:** Build a virtual lab environment to provide hands-on experience in advanced threat detection and incident response, enhancing cybersecurity skills through realistic simulations in a controlled environment.

**Achievements**
- **Detection and Logging:** Successfully identified and logged attacks such as password spraying using Sysmon data ingested into Splunk.
- **Automated Alerts:** Configured Splunk to trigger automated alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.
- **Incident Investigation:** Used Splunk dashboards and alerts to investigate and mitigate attack scenarios effectively.

**Skills Learned**
- **Intrusion Detection:** Configured Snort IDS for monitoring network-based threats.
- **Endpoint Threat Monitoring and Response:** Utilized LimaCharlie EDR to detect and respond to endpoint threats in real time.
- **SIEM Mastery:** Gained proficiency in configuring and managing Splunk for log analysis, alerting, and tracking network anomalies.
- **Incident Response:** Applied NIST Incident Response Plan phases to handle cyber incidents effectively.
- **Threat Analysis and Simulation:** Leveraged MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain for analyzing attacker TTPs and testing detection and response with realistic attack simulations.
- **Blue Team Operations:** Developed skills in monitoring, detecting, and responding to threats in an Active Directory environment.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyzed network behavior and identified suspicious patterns, filtering malicious traffic.
- **Malware Analysis Fundamentals:** Practiced basic reverse-engineering to understand malware persistence and lateral movement behaviors.
